This is my week14 Project working with React.
It utilizes different components, props and state.
Wrapping my head around passing state and functions through
props took quite a bit of time. I think there is a lot of refactoring that could be done on this project. I'm not happy with both modals being on the moviecard component. They should probably be on the review list and on the Reviewform component but I'm just happy everything is working. 

I ran into a big challenge with the starselection component and had to figure out passing the state there and getting it all to work. Overall I'm happy with the project but would love to do some more styling and better code organization.
